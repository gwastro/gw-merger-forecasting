## Abstract ##
We present the prospects for the early (pre-merger) detection and localization of compact-binary
coalescences using gravitational waves over the next 10 years. Early warning can enable the direct
observation of the prompt and early electromagnetic emission of a neutron star merger. We examine
the capabilities of the ground based detectors at their “Design” sensitivity (2021-2022), the planned
“A+” upgrade (2024-2026), and the envisioned “Voyager” concept (late 2020’s). We find that for a
fiducial rate of binary neutron star mergers of 1000 Gpc−3
yr−1
, the Design, A+, and Voyager era
networks can provide 18, 54, and 195s of warning for one source per year of observing, respectively,
with a sky localization area <100 deg2 at a 90% credible level. At the same rate, the A+ and
Voyager era networks will be able to provide 9 and 43s of warning, respectively, for a source with <10
deg2
localization area. We compare the idealized search sensitivity to that achieved by the PyCBC
Live search tuned for pre-merger detection. The gravitational-wave community will be prepared to
produce pre-merger alerts. Our results motivate the operation of observatories with wide fields-of-view,
automation, and the capability for fast slewing to observe simultaneously with the gravitational-wave
network.

## Data Release ##

This respository contains summary data needed to recreate the figures from the paper. Upon request we would also
be glad to make available the low level data products, including simulated search results and sky localizations for
each simulated signal. Due to github default file/repo size constraints, this data is not included in this
repository at this time.
